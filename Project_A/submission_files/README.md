# Supplementary File Contents

This repository contains the following files and directories:

1. **networks.ipynb**: This is a Python notebook that provides six different networks, including MLP, Convent, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG11, and ResNet-18. This file is used for learning synthetic dates on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

2. **mhist_dataset**: This directory contains two subdirectories, which include the images and their annotations for the MHIST dataset. All 3152 images are in the images.zip file. Annotations are included in annotations.csv. This file includes each image file name, its corresponding majority-vote label, and degree of annotator agreement expressed as the number of annotators who marked the image as SSA (e.g., 6 indicates 6/7 agreement with a ground truth of SSA, and 2 would indicate 5/7 agreement with a ground truth of HP).

3. **utils.ipynb**: This is a Python notebook that provides utilities such as access to datasets, preprocessing, and data augmentation. This file is used for learning synthetic dates on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

4. **Project_B_FAQs.pdf**: This is a list of frequently asked questions that aim to answer (almost) all of your questions and concerns that you may have during Project A.
